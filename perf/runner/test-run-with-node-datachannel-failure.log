FIRST RUN (--testing flag, 1 iteration):
- webrtc-roamhq-wrtc: FAILED with stream.sink is not a function
- webrtc-node-datachannel: NOT TESTED (skipped by runner)

SECOND RUN (10 iterations):
- v2.8 TCP: SUCCESS
- webrtc-roamhq-wrtc: SUCCESS for upload/download/latency
- webrtc-node-datachannel: NOT TESTED (still not included)

ERROR: stream.sink is not a function
- This is libp2p v2 vs v3 API incompatibility
- @libp2p/perf v4.x expects v3 streams (with .sink property)
- libp2p v2.8.0 provides v2 streams (IS the sink function)

SOLUTION NEEDED:
Both webrtc-node-datachannel AND webrtc-roamhq-wrtc must use exact libp2p v2 dependencies
